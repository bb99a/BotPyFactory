Legal and Ethical Considerations

Before using this web scraper, please be aware of the following:

    Respect robots.txt: Many websites use a robots.txt file to define access policies for web crawlers. Always check and respect the rules specified in robots.txt.

    Rate Limiting: To avoid putting excessive load on servers, implement rate limiting in your requests. Modify the scraper to make requests at a reasonable interval.

    User Agent: Using a user agent string that accurately identifies your scraper can help website administrators understand the nature of the traffic. Consider providing contact information within the user agent string.

    Compliance with Terms of Service: Review the terms of service for any website you plan to scrape. Ensure your use of the scraper does not violate these terms.

    Data Usage: Be mindful of how you use and distribute data obtained through scraping. Respect data privacy and intellectual property rights.



# My Web Scraper

This project is a simple web scraper designed to extract various types of information from websites. It's built using Python and leverages libraries such as `requests` and `BeautifulSoup4`.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project is tested with Python 3.8+, but it should work with other versions with minor adjustments.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone https://example.com/my_web_scraper.git


Replace `https://example.com/my_web_scraper.git` with the actual URL of your Git repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

Change into the project directory:

cd my_web_scraper

**Create a Virtual Environment**

Create a virtual environment named `env` within the project directory:

- On Windows:
  ```
  python -m venv env
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```
  python3 -m venv env
  ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
  ```
  .\env\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

You should now see `(env)` at the beginning of your command line prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

5. **Install Required Packages**
