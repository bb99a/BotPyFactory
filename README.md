# Random Bots & Automation Scripts in Python

## About The Project

This project is a collection of Python scripts designed for automating tasks and creating bots for various purposes. Automation of mundane tasks, these scripts leverage the power of Python to make life easier and more productive.

### Built With

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
  
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip

### Installation

A comprehensive guide for users on installing Python and running a script. This guide is designed for users who may not have Python installed or are unfamiliar with running Python scripts.

# Installation Guide

## Step 1: Installing Python

### For Windows Users:

1. Download the Python installer from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Choose the version that is compatible with your operating system (usually Python 3.x).
   
2. Run the downloaded installer. Make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python 3.x to PATH"** before clicking **"Install Now."**

3. Once the installation is complete, open the Command Prompt and type `python --version` to verify the installation. You should see the Python version number if the installation was successful.

### For macOS Users:

1. Python 2.7 is usually pre-installed on macOS, but you'll likely need Python 3. Visit the official Python website to download the installer: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Open the downloaded `.pkg` file to run the installer.

3. Follow the installer's instructions. After installation, open the Terminal and type `python3 --version` to verify that Python 3 was installed correctly.

### For Linux Users:

Python is usually pre-installed on Linux distributions. To check if Python 3 is installed and to install it if it isn't, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Check the installed Python version by typing `python3 --version`. If Python 3 is installed, you'll see the version number.

3. If Python 3 is not installed, you can install it using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu or Debian, you can install Python 3 by running:

   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3
   ```

## Step 2: Running a Python Script

1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt.**

2. **Navigate to the Directory Containing Your Script.**

   Use the `cd` command followed by the path to the directory where your script is located. For example:

   ```sh
   cd path/to/your/script
   ```

3. **Run the Script.**

   Once you're in the correct directory, run the script by typing:

   ```sh
   python script_name.py
   ```

   Replace `script_name.py` with the name of your script. If you're using Python 3 and have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, you might need to use `python3` instead of `python`:

   ```sh
   python3 script_name.py
   ```
